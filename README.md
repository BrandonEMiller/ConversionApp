ConversionApp
=============

A simple unit converting app.

This application was one of my first projects at The Iron Yard Academy that heavily utilized javascript and shows a lot of errors and mistakes of someone just starting out.

It was also the first application built that used the Yeoman Web App generator.

This application is one I intend to revist one day to clean up by refactoring code and styles.
